2.11. Mixed Up Code Practice
Try to solve each of the following mixed-up code problems or try the experimental switch between mixed up or write code versions of these problems on the next page instead.
For these mixed up code problems, drag the blocks into the correct order. Click the Check Me button to check each solution. You will be told if your solution is too short, has a block in the wrong order, or you are using the wrong block. Some of the problems may have an extra block that isn’t needed in the correct solution. After 3 tries, you can ask for help and some of the blocks will be combined. You can solve these on your phone or other mobile device!
The main method in the following class should print a random number from 1 to 50. But, the blocks have been mixed up and may include an extra block that isn’t needed in the solution. Drag the needed blocks from the left and put them in the correct order on the right. Click the Check button to check your solution.
